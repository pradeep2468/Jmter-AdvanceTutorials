How to create a Database Test Plan.

Pre-Requisite : MySql database.

This configuration used to hit/query/request the Mysql database and get the response back to jmeter.


1.	Download the mysql jdbc jar from the below url.
  	https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.0.html
2.	Copy the mysql-connector-java-5.1.44-bin.jar(mysqljdbc jar) to the jmeter/lib folder.
3.	Start Jmeter gui from the jmeter/bin folder.
4.	To the Test plan add Thread group-> Right click and add JDBC connection configuration element from the config element.
5.	At Variable Name Bound to pool section provide the Variable Name which is mandatory.(Ex:mydb)
6.	Let the values be default for Connection pool, Validation by pool.
7.	At Database Connection Configuration section: Enter the required values.
